🧩 How It Works
🦸 Hero Cards
Hero data is stored in JavaScript and dynamically rendered into the page.

Hover: plays a quick sound effect
Click: opens a detailed biography modal
🪟 Modal Window
Each card opens a popup that includes:

Hero name
Bio text pulled from the dataset
A close button to exit
👀 Scroll Animations
Cards fade in as they enter the viewport using the Intersection Observer API, adding a dynamic feel as users scroll.
